[381, 385]    "I've always had lots of moles, some birthmarks, and I think I'm the only one in my family with that many. So I was used to relatively regular screening from a young age and even had my first biopsy around 12 years old. Now I'm 24, and when I was a teenager, I had a traumatic incident that made it very hard for me to let anyone near my crotch. Needless to say, my [most worrying mole](http://imgur.com/a/Jglwy3S) is right up where the leg ends, maybe an inch away. I had a removal scheduled 5 years ago and ended up screaming and crying in panic while the dermatologist was telling me that I would die if I didn't let them get to it. They ended up walking out of the room while I was still naked. Fun times.
[46, 83]    According to the American organization NCCN ([National Comprehensive Cancer Network](https://www.nccn.org/)), the main risk factors for the development of melanoma are:

It was beyond terrible to have to watch this and only be able to do so much to help. Now that shes gone i feel guilty for feeling relief. Relief that she doesn't have to go through this, relief that it no longer consumes my whole life. I don't really know where im going with this, but if someone else has been in a similar situation, i think it would help to hear that this is normal. That someone else knows this feeling i have.

[26, 30]    Months ago I noticed this mole(s) on my upper left forearm. 
[174, 180]    The dermatologist said that even though it didnt look typical for melanoma, they dont always present as a streak, and he couldnt tell for sure what it was either. He took a [biopsy](https://imgur.com/mR1nJCR), and the area wasnt numbed, but it it was more unpleasant than painful. 
[57, 60]    "Okay, so here it goes. In October 2017 my [F36] husband[M50] was diagnosed with stage IV melanoma. We were told with no treatment he would not have seen Christmas. Luckily he chose treatment option so here we are in July and he is alive....but not well. See, itÔøΩs this - I can deal with the dying bit, itÔøΩs hard, itÔøΩs sad - it effing sucks but I can do this. We have two awesome children (M10 and f8) and at the end of the day, I know we will be okay. What I canÔøΩt deal with, is knowing his in a terminally ill situation and he chooses to be angry. All. The. Time.  
[174, 177]    Has anyone had success with this anxiety? I call it that, but it feels more like abject terror. And I‚Äôm so worried about blowing things out of the water and overreacting. 
I(19f, stage 4 melanoma with 2 brain metastasis). 
I received one high dose of radiation to the spots on my brain. it was horrible and scary but yesterday i was brushing out my hair and a lot came out. i have naturally curly hair so its natural to me to lose a  bit of hair. 
[21, 26]    I also struggle with CPTSD(family and medical related), heavy Anxiety, most likely Autism (looking to be diagnosed) and Survivors Guilt. 
[169, 176]    My grandfather died of Stage IV bowel cancer, my Father in law is dying of Stage IV Melanoma, and I had Stage II Testicular Cancer, and then caught the second tumour at Stage I.

[117, 121]    So then palliative care had me on oxycontin 40mg x2 a day (which definetly helped) and nasal ketamine for break thru pain(I don't think the ketamine did anything) 
[149, 157]    See the Oncologist 2 days later and they order a PET scan and a MRI of the skull and orbits. The next Friday they drop the bomb on us. My wife had 3 biopsies(sp) done. The first 2 were inconclusive but said that the best educated guess would be Malignant Melanoma because my wife is a redhead with fair skin. 3rd biopsy was an actual surgical procedure to make sure they get enough material to get all of the genetic markers that they need to give a rock solid Dx.
[134, 154]    I got surgery on Halloween üëª (dressed up as a banana to go to the hospital of course üçå) and am recovering now. I am waiting for the sentinel node biopsy results. 
[655, 666]    OK, I'm done now. I was just on a rant. My anger is passing. I breathe. I realize that it would be hard to actively regulate. Things work fine as they are with the collective calling out quacks in concern. Still, it would be nice to have some basic guidelines? Like 'only peer-reviewed claims of cancer studies will be accepted' or something? I don't know, I'm not a doctor or an oncologist, although I've seen enough of 'em. I'm also a big fan of science and it breaks my poor, chemo-brained head to hear the same bollocks over and over again on here. But whatever, freedom of speech and all. I'm done for now. Carry on. And if anyone ever wants to chat skin cancer(s), I'm here for you. 
[4, 7]    We (37f)(37m) are taking every day as it comes and are trying hard to be optimistic, but we‚Äôre also painfully aware of the chances of a successful outcome.

[36, 39]    IÔøΩm 33 yrs old male and live in the U.K. 
[45, 48]    "Stage 4 melanoma with multiple brain Mets.  49M.
[77, 80]    I donÔøΩt know what to do. We donÔøΩt have medical insurance, and the mole on my arm(which already has been told by many people including our neighbor who has survived melanoma to get it checked out) is changing.
[106, 109]    I had gamma knife surgery few months ago due to 13 mets found in my brain. My next scan is at the weekend(MRI) and IÔøΩm keeping my fingers crossed that it will come back clear. 
[10, 13]    My sister(F40), has been diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. She underwent a mastectomy a few months ago and this week will be her second round of chemotherapy AC.
[25, 27]    Thank you for reading.
I(19) have melanoma stage 3a(at least) melanoma and am BRAF positive. I have just started to process the fact that (I am young and I never pictured cancer to put everything else on the slideline so the way I coped so far is to pretend everything is normal)

[174, 183]    Hello everyone. I have been having some very weird problems with my mole (that i had since Forever, my father had the same on in the same place So i guess it could even be a birthmark)in the last couple of months and the nature of some symptoms is making me super worried for possible melanoma, while some symptoms dont really check the boxes for what is written on the internet.
